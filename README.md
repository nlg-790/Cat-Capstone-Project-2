Initial Plan
1.	I will be using React and node 
2.	I think that the project will be full stack but there will be more of an emphasis on front-end
3.	This will be a website
4.	Since cats are all over the internet and since they are synonymous with internet culture, why not have a site entirely dedicated to all things cats? Including breeds, temperaments, information about exotic big cats, and a cat of the day which is a link to that cat’s page. Plus there can be educational sections and more entertaining sections of cat videos and photos
5.	The main target audience is cat lovers, which is a very broad audience on the internet. Plus animal lovers and exotic animal lovers who wish to learn more about exotic big cats.
6.	I will be collecting data about pet cats and exotic cats throughout the internet. Along with using the API.
7.	A. The schema would be in VS Code and in separate files based off of type of cat and type of page. One will have cats, videos, photos
B. Issues with API including getting the token to work, making sure the API is compatible, and that it flows
C. There is no sensitive material.
D. There will be a home page, a section for pet cats, a section for exotic cats, each section could have videos and photos, and there can be a separate section only for videos and photos
E. You start at the home page, and then there’s a cat of the day front and center which is also a link to that cat’s page. But, the homepage will have buttons for the sections mentioned above. 
F. This app is interactive and very dopamine triggering since each page for each cat provides not just information, but multiple videos and photos and also CSS that is eye appealing. The stretch goal is to have a place for cats on the internet rather than being scattered randomly across memes and posts on social media.

For my project, I began by setting the technology used for the project. I initially decided to use Python for the backend and React for the front end. I made a directory called Capstone-Project-2 and added a package.json file and installed react in the terminal. I then made a react folder called client. I added express as well to give me flexibility with the tools that I could use so that I had more options as i was making the project, such as parsing API requests to make API access easier when building the site.

 I tested express by adding code into the server.js file with a simple "hello world" and then running node server.js. Then, I set up python in terminal for the backend and used a virtual environment as well as installing Flask, so that I could truly make the most out of Python. Like express, Flask gives me many tools for python that gives me more options for tools to use, such as "flask run", which allows me to run the site to see how the site is running so far and to make necessary debugs. To connect the backend to the frontend, I added "proxy": "http://localhost:5000". Then, to test react, i ran npm start to make sure that react was indeed installed and that it was running properly before I added content. I then added the app.py file for python so that API requests can be made seamlessly. 
 
 I then tested the API in the terminal by tying curl GET and then the api's url. This was to ensure that the API does indeed work and that my requests work before I set them up in the app. Next up, I tested the react tech by adding content to the App.js page so that there would be content aside from the spinning logo. This way, I can now add content and more pages. 
 
 After that, I added the files in the src folder called pages. Within pages, I added three pages called BreedsPage.js, FactsPage.JS and ImagesPage.js.,each with vague content so that I could test the navigation throughout the site before I added the needed content for each page. I then made the main App.js pages link to those pages. I did this by importing each page and technology that i needed to link starting with Import React fron 'react'; and import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';. The latter part handles url changes and route changes so that the sites link. Then, i linked all of the new files that i made starting with import HomePage from './pages/HomePage';. This entails that the App.js page is the main entry point for the app to allow navigation between every page. I tested it out to make sure that the site was good and up and running. 
 
 ImagesPage.js
 On each of the pages in the pages folder in their js files, I added import React, { useState, useEffect }from 'react';import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';import './ScatteredImagesPage.css'; each at the top of the pages and adjusted to their appropriate imports. This updates the UI and links every page and applies the effects and decorations from their respective CSS pages. Then, I adjusted the images page so that when you press a button, it will give you a random image as a get request from the API. const ImagesPage = () => {
const [images, setImages] = useState([]); this line stores the fetched images. const fetchImages = () => {
const url = 'https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=1'; fetch(url, { headers: {'x-api-key': process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}}).then(response => response.json()) This parses the sponse into a JSON object. .then(data => setImages(data)) Sets the `images` state with the fetched data .catch(error => console.error(error));}; Logs any errors to the console. <div className='images-page'> This is the main container with a class for styling. <p>Click On Random Cat Below and Get a New Random Cat Every Time You Click!</p> I made a text to instruct the user and to make it exciting. <button className='random-cat-btn' onClick={fetchImages}>Random Cat</button> This is a button that triggers the fetchImages function to get a new random cat image. <img key={image.id} src={image.url} alt="Cat" width="500" /> Displays each fetched cat image 
<button><Link to="/">Back to Home</Link></button> This brings you back to the home page. export default ImagesPage; exports the ImagesPage component to be used in other parts of the application. export default ImagesPage; In order for the page to work across the app. it needs to be exported. 



BreedsPage.js
I then did the same for the breeds page where you type in a breed as a get request and it returns the information about the breed. const BreedsPage = () => {
const [breeds, setBreeds] = useState([]); this works the same way as the images page by storing fetched information from the API.const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState(''); this stores the user's search input. const [filteredBreeds, setFilteredBreeds] = useState(null); this holds the list of breeds that match the search query. const [hasSearched, setHasSearched] = useState(false); this tracks the performance of the search. useEffect(() => {fetch('https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds', Makes an HTTP GET request to fetch breed data from The Cat API.{headers: {'x-api-key': process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY this authorizes the API key.}})
.then(response => response.json()) This parses the sponse into a JSON object as shown above. .then(data => setBreeds(data)) This also works the same but instead fetches the 'breeds' state. .catch(error => console.error(error)); Logs any errors to the console.}, This also logs errors. []); Empty dependency array ensures the effect runs once, after the component mounts. const handleSearch = () => {
const filtered = breeds.filter(breed => This filters the breeds array. breed.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) This checks if the breed's name matches the search query.); setFilteredBreeds(filtered); This updates filterBreeds with the search results.  setHasSearched(true); This is to confirm that a search has been performed};. <div className='breeds-page'> This is the specific container for the breeds page, with a specific CSS class for styling. <h1>Feline Breed Search</h1> <p>Type a Breed Below to Learn All About It!</p> These are the texts that you see on the page with h1 being the title and p being the subtitle. This is the input field for the user to type in the breed search query.<input type="text"  Specifies the type of input as text. value={searchQuery}  Binds the input's value to the state variable 'searchQuery'. onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)} Updates the 'searchQuery' state on user input.
placeholder="Search for cat breeds" Placeholder text in the search bar. <button onClick={handleSearch}>Search</button> This makes the search button work.</div> These are all specifics to this page {hasSearched && filteredBreeds && filteredBreeds.map(breed => (<div key={breed.id}> Creates a container for each filtered breed.
<h2>{breed.name}</h2> Displays the breed name.
<p><strong>Origin:</strong> {breed.origin}</p>  Breed's origin.
<p><strong>Life Span:</strong> {breed.life_span} years</p> Lifespan.
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> {breed.weight.metric} kg</p> Weight.

{breed.image && <img src={breed.image.url} alt={breed.name} width="200" />} // Conditionally displays the breed's image if available.</div>))} export default BreedsPage; this exports the page for use across the entire app. 


ListOfBreedsPage.js
Next, I made a list of breeds page so that every breed is listed in one place without having to click on anything on this page. const [breeds, setBreeds] = useState([]); Initializes state 'breeds' as an empty array to store breed data. useEffect(() => {fetch('https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds', { Makes a GET request to fetch breed data from The Cat API. headers: {'x-api-key': process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY This works the same way as the other bages by adding an API key from environment variables for authentication. .then(response => response.json()).then(data => setBreeds(data)).catch(error => console.error(error)); These also work the same way by parsing the response to JSON format, updating the breeds state with the fetched data and logging erors that occur during the fetch. return ( <div className='list-of-breeds-page'> works the same way as the other pages with the container for the css page. <h1>Breed List</h1> This is the heading that you see on the page. <p className='intro-text'>Here's a Large List of Various Feline Breeds</p> This is the subtitle that describes the page. <button><Link to="/">Back to Home</Link></button>  this brings you back to the home page when you click on it. <div key={breed.id} className='breed-container'> this is the container for each breed. <h2>{breed.name}</h2>  Displays the name of the breed.<p>{breed.description}</p> /Displays a brief description of the breed.</div> <button><Link to="/">Back to Home</Link></button> 
this brings you directly back to the homepage again. I decided to add two homepage buttons because when you scroll all the way down, another homepage button works as a shortcut instead of scrolling all the way back up. export default ListOfBreedsPage; Exports the ListOfBreedsPage component for use in other parts of the app.

FactsPage.js
 Also, I made a facts page where you click on the button and the api fetches a random facts from the /breeds endpoint. I couldn’t use the /facts endpoint because I do not have premium. const FactsPage = () => { const [breeds, setBreeds] = useState([]); This is the exact same line as the breeds page where i fetch information from the API. const [randomFact, setRandomFact] = useState(''); randomFact holds the current value of a random cat fact and setRandomFact updates the randomFact state. useState('') has an empty string and it is updated when setRandomFact is activated.  useEffect(() => {fetch('https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds', {headers: {'x-api-key': process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}
}) This works the same as the other pages by making an HTTP GET request to fetch from the specific API URL .then(response => response.json())this converts the response to JSON format. .then(data => {setBreeds(data);})This updates the breeds state with the fetched data..catch(error => console.error(error)); this logs any errors that occur during fetching. }, []); the empty array means the code runs after the component mounts. const handleRandomFact = () => {if (breeds.length > 0) { This checks if the breeds array is not empty. const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * breeds.length); this generates a random index within the array length. 
const breed = breeds[randomIndex]; Selects a random breed from the `breeds` array. const fact = `The ${breed.name}, originated from ${breed.origin}, is known for its ${breed.temperament}. It has a life span of ${breed.life_span} years.`; Constructs a fact about the selected breed.
setRandomFact(fact); Updates the `randomFact` state with the new fact.} }; <div className='facts-page'> container for the CSS page. <h1>Cat Facts!</h1> This is the heading. I added an exclamation point for added excitement. <p>Get Ready to Be Surprised by Clicking on Get Random Cat Fact!</p> This text is displayed to envoke enthusiasm in the user.  <button className='facts-btn' onClick={handleRandomFact}>Get Random Cat Fact</button> this fetches a random cat when it is clicked. {randomFact && <p>{randomFact}</p>} this will render the random cat in the API.  <button><Link to="/">Back to Home</Link></button>  here you click this and it brings you back home.export default FactsPage; this allows the FactsPage to be exported across the different pages on the app.  

ScatteredImagesPage.js
Then, I decided to have a page where there are 10 cats on display from the images endpoint. I decided to include a page where the user doesn’t have to do anything and just embrace the cats they are provided. const ScatteredImagesPage = () => { const [images, setImages] = useState([]); Initializes 'images' state as an empty array. useEffect(() => {fetchRandomImages(); this calls fetchRandomImages on component mount.
}, []); Empty dependency array ensures it runs once after the component mounts. const fetchRandomImages = () => {
const url = 'https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=10'; This is the specific API endpoint to fetch 10 random cat images. fetch(url, {headers: {'x-api-key': process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY // This adds the API key for authorization. .then(response => response.json()) // This converts the response to JSON format. .then(data => setImages(data)) Updates the 'images' state with fetched data. .catch(error => console.error(error)); Logs any errors that occur during fetching. return (
<div className='scattered-images-page'> this links the css page.  <h1>10 Cats for You Because You're Awesome!</h1> Here is the title that compliments the user so that the page always interacts positively with whoever is using it. <div className='images-container'> Holds the images of cats.{images.map(image => (<img key={image.id} src={image.url} alt="Cat" /> Dynamically renders each cat image from the 'images' array.))} </div>  <button><Link to="/">Back to Home</Link></button> Home button. export default ScatteredImagesPage; exports by allowing use accross every page in the file. 

HomePage.js
Then,I decided to have another page that lists every breed from the API along with a short description. This way, the user can learn about certain breeds without having to search. And if they find a specific one they want to learn more about, they can search for that breed in the breeds page. Everything was going through the App.js file, but I needed page that would have all of the buttons to go to every page, because the heading the content on the home page was showing up on every page, and I wanted each page to have its own content. Therefore, I made a new file called HomePage.js.  <div className="home-page"> This is the main container for the home page, with a specific CSS class for styling when i do the CSS. <header className="App-header"><h1>The Cat Interface</h1> This displays "The Cat Interface" on the website. </header> <h2>The Internet Loves Cats. So Why Not Have Them In One Place?</h2> This displays that text on the page as well. <div className="links-container"> This is a container for the navigation links and images.
<div className="link-item"> This is a single item containing an image and a link. <img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-07/220726-cat-theo-elise-ew-636p-6cd3b0.jpg" alt="One Cat" /> This is the specific link to the image that is displayed on the page. <Link to="/images" className="link-button">One Cat for You!</Link> This is the link to the "/images" route. The same logic applies to all other links on this page. </div> closes the links-container div. </div> // Closing the home-page main container.);export default HomePage; Exports the HomePage component so it can be used in other parts of the application.

Now I can decorate. Now onto the css. I made a homepage.css file before making the others and I tested it by giving it a background color to make sure it works, and it did. So now I can do the rest of the pages. Each page now gets a CSS. For the BreedSearch page, I deided to have a background image of a cat room in a home to associate cats and homes for those searching for a specific breed to bring into theirs. Next, I did the background for The List of Breeds Page. I went for a jungle theme for this one because bit cats like tigers and jaguars are often associated with the jungle. The link between cats and the wild jungles made me associate all cats with the jungle, which is why I chose it to represent all of them listed. Next up, I did the Image Page. Here, since you were constantly shown random cats, I wanted to use colors on this page associated with cats. So, I used a very light creamy orange and a very light grey, which is a very common cat color. Also, for the button, I used a light beige to accent the other two colors. Plus, I added an effect where the button changes to an even lighter version of the same color when you hover over it. I also made the button bigger so that clicking on it is more tempting. Next, I did the Scattered Images Page. Like the random images page, I wanted the background colors to best associate to cats, since there would be a ton of cats on screen. So, I went with a deep russet and warm cream. After that, the random facts page. For this page, I found an image of a cat wearing a sweater with glasses on its collar. The cat is standing over an open book. I thought because of the sites theme and specific page’s theme, it was most appropriate. Each background also is faded so that the content on the page is legible. I then did the homepage. For the homepage background, I used one with a bunch of yarn balls and a cats paw, since yarn is synonymous with cats. I then made the url links into buttons and each with a picture over them associating with the theme of the page link. For the one that says One Cat For You!, I had a picture of one cat with its head peaking over furniture. For A Bunch of Cats For You!, I found an image of a group of cats. Next, for All Breeds Info, I found an image of a bunch of big cats to differentiate house cats from wild cats. For Specific Breeds Info, I had a picture of a cat being examined by a vet, as vets provide specific information for breeds. Lastly, for random facts, I found a picture of a cat wearing glasses and a bow tie with lab equipment to channel facts and knowledge. I then did made colors for the buttons and headings accent the colors of the yarn balls from the background. Next, I went back and adjusted the title in the a ton of cats page and added a banner. I gave the text and banner the colors orange and beige to go with the colors on the page in the background. Next up, I adjusted the title and Subtitle for the Breed list. To go with the jungle theme and background, I made Breed List Dark Green with a light green when you hover over it, and the subtital a dark brown with a light brown when you hover over that as well. Next up was the Breed Search Page again. I adjusted it so that Feline Search Breed was a Dark Pink and the subtital was a granite, each with hovering covers making them lighter, along with making the search bar pink with a darker pink as the hover. Last but not least, I went to Cat Facts! I made the letters all blue because blue is often associated with intelligence. Those were the final adjustments. So the end result is a very welcoming and cozy website dedicated to cats. You can get an image of a cat, images of 10 cats, information about a ton of breeds, a way to search for specific breeds, and a place to get random facts. Now, cats on the internet can be in one place. I would say that the easiest part of making this app was the creative end and deciding which pictures to use and colors. The most difficult part was integrating the API since I had to incorporate code that is not mine, so I had to learn someone else's code and coding style so that I could use it in my app. Also, The logic was difficult in the beginning to set up in the pages, but they became easier as the page was being made because the logic was mostly consistent across the pages, so it allowed for repetition and me eventually learning how each line truly works.
