<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Documentation

For my project, I began by setting the technology used for the project. I initially decided to use Python for the backend and React for the front end. I made a directory called Capstone-Project-2 and added a package.json file and installed react. I then made a react folder called client. I added express as well to give me flexibility with the tools that I could use so that I had more options as i was making the project. I then tested express by adding code into the server.js file with a simple "hello world" and then running node server.js. Then, I set up python for the backend and used a virtual environment as well as installing Flask, so that I could truly make the most out of Python. Like express, Flask gives me many tools for python that gives me more options for tools to use. To connect the backend to the frontend, I added "proxy": "http://localhost:5000". Then, to test react, i ran npm start to make sure that react was indeed installed and that it was running properly before I added content.
